# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior
and will take appropriate action in response to any behavior they deem
inappropriate.

Instances of abusive or unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the
maintainers.
